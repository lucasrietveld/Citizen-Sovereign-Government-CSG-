## 1. Distributed Authority
In CSG, authority is distributed equally across citizens.  
- Not token-weighted.  
- Not shareholder-based.  
- Each citizen carries equal sovereign allocation of their purse share.  
This prevents plutocracy by design.  

---

## 2. Transparency and Auditability
Transparency is non-negotiable, but the technology substrate is flexible.  
- Blockchain is one option, but not a dependency.  
- The principle is deductive auditability: allocations and results must be visible and testable.  

---

## 3. Incentive Alignment
Incentives align because the purse is deductive.  
- Programs survive only while delivering value.  
- Bad programs starve, good programs grow.  
- No tokens, no staking — persuasion, truth, and results are the only currencies.  

---

## 4. Automation and Enforcement
Automation is a tool, not the core.  
- Smart contracts, AI validators, or human auditors may enforce rules.  
- The heart is the **Pentivium truth-test**: allocations survive only if they remain logically sound.  

---

## 5. Participatory Decision-Making
CSG is not partial budgeting or consultation.  
- Every citizen allocates their share directly.  
- All governance is participatory because all purse shares are sovereign.  

---

## ✦ Final Framing
Citizen-Sovereign Governance (CSG) is not simply “decentralized governance.”  

- **Not a DAO clone** — equality of citizens replaces token voting.  
- **Not blockchain-bound** — tech serves the principle, not the other way around.  
- **Not conceptual only** — the Pentivium provides the deductive closure.  
- **Not vulnerable to plutocracy** — wealth cannot buy allocations.  
- **Not utopian** — powerholders are co-opted, not excluded; ambition refines into legacy.  

**CSG = Deductive Governance.**  
The purse follows proof, not power.
